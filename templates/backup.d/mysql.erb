### authentication ###

# three authentication methods:
#
# 1. setting the user, so that /home/user/.my.cnf is used.
# user = some-unix-user
#
# 2. specifying the mysql dbuser and dbpassword,
#    which generates a temporary .my.cnf in /root/.my.cnf
# dbusername  = <some-mysql-user>
# dbpassword  = <password>
#
# 3. specify which config file to use with configfile
#    (this option does not work with hotcopy)
# configfile = /etc/mysql/debian.cnf
#
# if user and dbusername are not specified, the default is to use
# /etc/mysql/debian.cnf for configfile.

### all options ###

# configfile = < path/to/file > (default = /etc/mysql/debian.cnf)
# The config file is passed to mysql with --defaults-file.
# On debian, this default will allow backupninja to make backups
# of mysql without configuring any additional options.
# (this option is not compatible with "user" or "dbusername").
#
# user = <user> (default = root)
# Run mysql commands as 'user'. A valid .my.cnf must exist with a
# database username and password in the user's home directory.
# (this option is not compatible with "configfile" or "dbusername").
#
# dbusername = <dbuser> (no default)
# The user must have access to the databases specified later.
# (this option is not compatible with "configfile" or "user").
#
# dbpassword = <dbpass> (no default)
# The password used with dbusername. this password will NOT be passed
# on the command line and is not readable using "ps aux".
#
# dbhost = <host> (default = localhost)
# only localhost works right now.
#
# databases = < all | db1 db2 db3 > (default = all)
# which databases to backup. should either be the word 'all' or a
# space separated list of database names.
#
# nodata = < db.table1 db.table2 db.table3 > (no default)
# only dump the structure for the database tables listed here, this means
# no data contained in these tables will be dumped. This is very useful
# to backup databases that have tables with large amounts of cache data that
# isn't necessary to backup, but you still need the structure to exist
# on a restore. You *must* specify the table as part of a database, such
# as "drupal.cache", where the database name is "drupal" and the table that
# you do not want to dump the data for is called "cache".
#
# backupdir = < path/to/destination > (default = /var/backups/mysql)
# where to dump the backups. hotcopy backups will be in a subdirectory
# 'hotcopy' and sqldump backups will be in a subdirectory 'sqldump'
#
# hotcopy = < yes | no > (default = no)
# make a backup of the actual database binary files using mysqlhotcopy.
#
# sqldump = < yes | no > (default = no)
# make a backup using mysqldump. this creates text files with sql commands
# sufficient to recontruct the database.
#
# sqldumpoptions = <options>
# (default = --lock-tables --complete-insert --add-drop-table --quick --quote-names)
# arguments to pass to mysqldump
#
# compress = < yes | no > (default = yes)
# if yes, compress the sqldump output.
#
# vsname = <vserver> (no default)
# what vserver to operate on (only used if vserver = yes
# in /etc/backupninja.conf), if you do not specify a vsname the
# host will be operated on
#
# NB: databases = all doesn't seem to work with hotcopy = yes
# when vsname is specified, I would like to know how to fix this.
